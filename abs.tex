When you double-clicked “ECE 499 template.dotx,” you opened a new, untitled document in Microsoft Word, which has the main components of your thesis laid out for you. Save the new document, replace the red text and bracketed section heads with your own, insert carefully prepared graphics, follow the Guidelines document, proofread and revise, and you’ll likely end up with a successful thesis. You may wish to change the line spacing to double rather than 1.5 lines; make sure the spacing is consistent throughout the thesis.
