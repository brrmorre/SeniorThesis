Giving a static semantics for Haskell including the module system but without support for type classes. The first part is the context free syntax in K. The entire context free syntax of the Haskell extended syntax is included. Any program written in Haskell extended syntax can be parsed into an abstract syntax tree. The programs can have multiple modules, but the multiple modules must be written in a single file. This is not official Haskell syntax, but allows for support of importing modules. The multiple modules are then put into a import tree and then context sensitive checks and type inferencing is performed on the modules of the tree in import order. All rules of the type system must take mutual recursion into account. There is repeated layering of inferences. Since the semantics is written in the K-Framework, it is mathematically precise and executable. Utilized executability to test both positive inferences and exceptional inferences. It is part of a larger project to give a formal semantics to Haskell.
