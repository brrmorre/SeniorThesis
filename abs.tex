In this thesis, I implemented a static semantics for Haskell in K. This includes support for the module system but not for type classes. The first part of the project is the implementation of the context free syntax of Haskell in K. The entire context free syntax of the Haskell extended syntax is included in the project. Since all the syntax is included, any program written in the Haskell extended syntax can be parsed into an abstract syntax tree. The programs can have multiple modules, but the multiple modules must be written in a single file. This is not official Haskell syntax, but allows for support of importing modules. The multiple modules are then put into an import tree. Then context sensitive checks and type inferencing is performed on the modules of the tree in import order. All rules of the type system must take mutual recursion into account. There is repeated layering of inferences. Since the semantics is written in the K-Framework, it is mathematically precise and executable. I utilized the executability of the semantics to test both positive inferences and exceptional inferences. This is part of a larger project to give a formal semantics to Haskell.
